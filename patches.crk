Make large address aware
haloce.exe
;-----------------------
;Normally 32-bit applications can only use up to 2GB of RAM. This patch increases that limit to 4GB.
;It is required for some maps and mods.
;
;Set the IMAGE_FILE_LARGE_ADDRESS_AWARE characteristic flag in the PE header
00000136: 0F 2F

Remove DRM and key checks
haloce.exe
;------------------------
;Allows playing and hosting games without requiring you or connecting players to have valid CD keys.
;This game was released in 2004 and can no longer be purchased. As a result most current players use
;cracked copies with one of a few common CD keys. Enforcing unique CD keys on your server will lead
;to many players being unable to join.
;
;Removes the check on startup "Your product key is invalid - we recommend reinstalling the game".
;Changes a `CMP`, `JZ` to a `JMP` to bypass the check.
00144C2B: 38 EB
00144C2C: 18 13
;
;Allows a server with a missing/invalid key to host an internet game.
;`NOP`s out a call to `_atol` to cause a later comparison to fail.
001BF82A: E8 90
001BF82B: C7 90
001BF82C: AC 90
001BF82D: 00 90
001BF82E: 00 90
;
;Disables checking the CD keys of incoming clients for duplicate keys.
;Changes a `JE` to a `JMP` to skip the check.
001BFF48: 74 EB


Bind server to 0.0.0.0
haloce.exe
;---------------------
;Fixes LAN game discovery and helps when running on systems with multiple interfaces. Can still bind
;to a specific IP using the `-ip` flag.
;
;The game uses WS2_32.gethostbyname(<your hostname>) to get your IP. This patch takes the result of
;that call and zeros it so the IP is "0.0.0.0".
;Replaces `OR ECX,EDX` with `XOR ECX,ECX` to zero out ECX.
00041695: 0B 31
00041696: CA C9


Disable safe mode prompt
haloce.exe
;-----------------------
;Prevents the safe mode prompt from showing and always tries to continue normally. Safe mode is
;completely broken on modern systems and is pretty easy to accidentally enable from the prompt.
;If you really want to try safe mode (why?), the `-safemode` launch flag still works.
;
;If something went wrong and "safe mode" is an option, just `JMP` to the end of the function.
;(safe mode is off by default)
001822D0: 8B E9
001822D1: 4D 57
001822D2: 08 02
001822D3: 51 00
001822D4: 8B 00
;
;Use `XOR EAX,EAX`, `RET` to always return 0 ("continue")
0018252C: 8B 31
0018252D: C3 C0


Disable modification of OS-level gamma
haloce.exe
;-------------------------------------
;In the stock version the current gamma level is saved in the registry on launch and the system-wide
;gamma level is set to whatever is specified by the in-game setting. When the game exits, the
;registry key is read and the gamma level is set back. This patch completely removes gamma
;modification and the associated registry keys.
;
;Disable adding the current gamma level to the registry on startup.
;Replace the first instruction in the function with `RET`.
00125860: 83 C3
;
;Disable in-game setting of gamma.
;Replace the first instruction in the function with `RET`.
00125AE0: A0 C3
;
;Disable resetting gamma level and setting the registry key when the game exits.
;Replace the first instruction in the function with `RET`.
00125A00: 83 C3


Fix blue explosions when using 32-bit textures
haloce.exe
;---------------------------------------------
;When using maps with uncompressed 32-bit textures, brown explosions would render as blue.
;Uncompressed 32-bit colors are defined in ARGB but laid out in memory as BGRA due to endianness.
;Without this patch, only the first 8 bits (the blue channel) were copied and the rest were set to
;0, causing blue explosions.
;
;Replace `MOVZX BYTE` with `MOV DWORD`
00127C57: 0F 8B
00127C58: B6 74
00127C59: 34 3A
00127C5A: 3A 00


Disable EULA
haloce.exe
;-----------
;Allows the game to be run without displaying the EULA. Removes the need for eula.dll to be present.
;
;Jump over code that checks for the "FIRSTRUN" registry key and loads eula.dll if it can't find it
;(eula.dll creates the key).
0014470D: 8D E9
0014470E: 55 93
0014470F: C8 00
00144710: 52 00
00144711: 68 00


Disable storing exit status in the registry
haloce.exe
;-----------------------------
;Makes the executable more portable by not requiring/adding registry keys.
;
;Disable setting the registry key "ExitFlag" to "clean" when exiting normally.
;Replace the first instruction in the function with `RET`.
00182000: 51 C3
;
;Bypass accessing the "ExitFlag" registry key on startup to check/set it.
;Replace the first instruction with `XOR EAX,EAX`, `RET` (return 0).
00181E40: 81 31
00181E41: EC C0
00181E42: 1C C3


Disable auto-centering the crosshair in vehicles
haloce.exe
;-----------------------------------------------
;In the stock version the crosshair in vehicles like the scorpion tank will slowly move towards the
;center of the screen as you drive. This prevents that behaviour.
;
;`NOP` out a `JP` (jump if the parity bit is set).
;Hypothesis: JP is using the frame count - JP jumps every second frame. By NOPing it out, we never
;jump and therefore never apply the auto-centering
0007512A: 7A 90
0007512B: 0B 90


Disable mouse acceleration
haloce.exe
;-------------------------
;These modifications take the built-in mouse acceleration curve and flatten it so no mouse
;acceleration is applied.
;
;Turn a `JLE` into a `JMP`.
;Skips a loop with some speed calculations and an early return if the speed is under a certain
;threshold.
0008F7E2: 7E EB
;
;Change an `FADD` to a `FLD` so the constant mouse speed is loaded into `ST0` instead of being
;added to the previous acceleration calculation.
0008F826: D8 D9


Block update checks
haloce.exe
;------------------
;Prevents checking for game updates. There probably won't be any but if there is you really don't
;want to be forced to download them. Plus, the check slows down the loading of the server list.
;
;Replaces the first instruction of the update check with `XOR EAX,EAX`, `RET` (return 0).
;A return code of 0 means no updates found.
0017A920: 55 31
0017A921: 8B C0
0017A922: EC C3


Disable camera shaking
haloce.exe
;---------------------
;Disables the camera shaking that happens when firing weapons or taking damage since it's a bit
;broken at high framerates.
;
;Turn a `JNE` into a `NOP`, `JMP` to skip over the code that applies the shaking.
000CC46D: 0F 90
000CC46E: 85 E9


Prevent descoping when taking damage
haloce.exe
;-----------------------------------
;Prevents zoomed-in weapons from descoping when the player takes damage.
;Note that this gives a significant advantage in some situations so it's probably best to only
;apply and use this if everyone you're playing with does as well.
;
;`NOP` out the call to the descope function

Add a link to this repo
haloce.exe
;----------------------
;Adds 'github.com/pR0Ps/halo-ce-patches' to an unused section of the executable.
